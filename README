Some simple Unix hacks that may or may not be useful.

For the most part, they are clones of various utilities found on some
commercial implementations of Unix.

  line     - Same as your regular line (reads one line) but has support
             for timeouts.

  rawline  - Same as `line' above, but puts the terminal into raw mode
             before doing the read.

  ttytype  - Basic terminal identification routines.  Detects various ANSI,
             HP, and Wyse terminals.
